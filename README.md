HorseFollow Plugin (Hytale)
Project status

In progress

Objective

Create a functional plugin that enables a taming-like mechanic for mounts in Hytale, a feature not yet available in the base game.

What it does

This plugin creates a bond between the player and a mount (horse).

When the player mounts a horse and uses the command:

The mount becomes linked to the player

The horse behavior is modified

If the player moves beyond a defined distance, the horse is pulled back to the player

The mount stays consistently close to its owner

The goal is a simple, functional, and reliable follow system, without complex AI or unnecessary mechanics.

Commands

/horsefollow bind — binds the horse you are currently riding

/horsefollow unbind — removes the active bond

/horsefollow status — shows whether a bond is active

Support & Patreon

I am currently unemployed and transitioning from an administrative role to programming. This is one of my first projects in this area.

The code may:

Not be fully clean yet

Contain inconsistencies

Have excessive comments

This is intentional and part of my learning process (commenting, testing, revising).

Any feedback is welcome and helps improve the mod.
